# Alyssa De Metro - Portfolio

- Alyssa De Metro is currently a Software Developer at Dabble Lab. This Repository holds her Portfolio website, hosted via Vercel and deployed at [alyssademetro.vercel.app](https://alyssademetro.vercel.app/) This website is roughly 5 hrs away from completion, but as of 5/31 it is very much still a work in progress so expect updates in the coming days.

- Part of these updates include the conversion of my tutorials from Markdown to JSX, so they are currently not available from the front end of the site. In the meantime, please see assets/markdownTutorials to view these tutorials in their rough, raw form.

## Running Locally

- To begin, clone this project to your local device, and from the project's root folder open the terminal. Run the commands below in succession.

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

- Open your broswer to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
